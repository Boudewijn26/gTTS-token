# Notice: With the changes made to Google Translate in November 2020, this project should no longer be necessary. This project will not be updated to maintain compatibility and dependents should change to the newer API. You can find a thorough analysis in [docs/november-2020-translate-changes](https://github.com/Boudewijn26/gTTS-token/blob/master/docs/november-2020-translate-changes.md). Feel free to @ me to help investigate future changes.
